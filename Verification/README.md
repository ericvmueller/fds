# FDS Verification

The folders above contain the FDS verification input files that are run each night by the firebot script contained in the repository [firemodels/bot](https://github.com/firemodels/bot). Detailed instructions for running and processing the verification cases are found in the wiki [FDS Verification Process](https://github.com/firemodels/fds/wiki/FDS-Verification-Process).

For those making substantial changes to the FDS source code, it is a good idea to run the verification cases in debug mode for a few time steps to quickly identify easy-to-make and easy-to-fix bugs, like array overshoots and divide by zeros. To do this, follow these steps:
1. cd to the `Verification` folder and do a `git clean -dxf` which will erase all uncommitted files within `Verification` and its subfolders, including old output files. Do not do this if there are files that you have not yet committed. Save these somewhere else.
2. cd to the `scripts` subfolder and issue the command `./Run_FDS_Cases.sh -m 2 -d -q firebot`. The `-m` option instructs FDS to only run the cases for 2 time steps. The `-d` option tells FDS to use the debug version of FDS. The `-q` option is the queue to use. At NIST, we use the `firebot` queue for this kind of quick testing.
3. cd back up to the `Verification` folder and issue the command `grep forrtl */*err` which will search all the diagnostic output files for Fortran run-time errors. Deal with these and then repeat.
4. When all the debug cases have run successfully, you can then clean the `Verication` folder again, cd to the `scripts` folder, and issue `./Run_FDS_Cases.sh -q firebot` which will run the cases in release mode. This takes a few hours. 
5. When the cases are done, run a few cases to test the restart feature with the command `./Run_FDS_Cases.sh -r`. These few cases take less than a minute to run.
6. Run the Matlab script in `Utilities/Matlab` called `FDS_verification_script.m`. This takes 10 to 15 minutes
7. When the Matlab script completes, cd to `Manuals/FDS_Verification_Guide/SCRIPT_FIGURES/Scatterplots` and open `verification_scatterplot_output.csv` using a spreadsheet editor and look for cases that have failed. Correct these and then repeat the process.
